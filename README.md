## Castle Enviroment
This is Unreal Engine Project without gameplay, because it main purpuse is to showcase a beautiful enviroment. Firsty, I used Sculpting mode to create a landscape, after that I used Megascans from Quixel bridge to make rocks more realistic, then I built the castle from the modular assetpack and aded trees via foliage mode. In the end, I was adding small details like grass, branches ect.
